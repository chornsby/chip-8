# Chip 8

![Test](https://github.com/chornsby/chip-8/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

This is a working Chip-8 emulator built to learn more about emulation and Rust
without following an explicit step-by-step tutorial.

You will need the [SDL2 library][0] installed in order to compile the project.

```bash
cargo run -- <path_to_rom>
```
